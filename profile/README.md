# IMPORTANT

The Fixed Template Project is current being reworked on. Please do not use our current modules since they won't work. 

## What's wrong with the current module?
This is due to how Vite builds their files. Once a Vite project is built, `React-Router-Dom` will not work. We are working on normal React and Preact templates.

## Will the new module be better?
We're working on having the templates already be built in with the module, meaning that you won't need to have git installed. This also helps us smash through alot of problems. Now we can install the template into a directory that has a `.github` folder. We're also now able to see the template be installed at a faster rate.

## When will it be released?
The new module will hopefully be released before the end of November. Just so you know, it should be released BEFORE that date, meaning that we can and will most likely release it much earlier than that given time.
